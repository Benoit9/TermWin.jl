# TermWin.jl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tonyhffong/TermWin.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tonyhffong/TermWin.jl)

## Introduction

TermWin.jl is a tool to help navigate deep data structure such as `Expr`, `Dict`, `Array`, `Module`. It uses a very
minimalist ncurses-based user interface.
```julia
using TermWin
ex = :( f(x) = x*x + 2x + 1 )
tshow(ex)
```

For `Function` and `MethodTable`, this would show a searchable (fuzzy) window:
```julia
using TermWin
tshow( deleteat! ) # searchable methods table
tshow( methods( deleteat! ) ) # ditto
tshow( methodswith( Set ) ) # searchable, too!
```

## Installation
```julia
Pkg.add( "TermWin" )
```

## Using TermWin to compose dialogs and ncurses applications

The key type is `TwObj`. It is the type that renders something.
TwScreen is just a typealias for TwObj, but it holds special role in
* directing key stroke traffic
* hold references to the content widgets and update them in the correct order

All widgets can be used in both blocking and non-blocking manner, though
some are more useful in blocking than non-blocking and others vice versa.

To use a widget for blocking use, instantiate that widget (if a container, 
put them inside too) and call
```julia
return_value = activateTwObj( widget )
```

To use a widget for non-blocking use, you need a container widget that is
actually blocking and put it inside the container.

## Focus and keystroke traffic logic
When a widget has the focus, it has first dip in interpreting any user
keystroke. Only when the widget gives up (by returning `:pass`), the container
(usually `TwScreen`) looks for other widgets also in play (when they have
grabUnusedKeys set to true, e.g. Menu). After all widgets pass, then the
container would try to interpret it itself. If a widget return :exit_ok, itâ€™s
instructing the container that it has got what it wanted. The container
may still choose to switch focus, or exit -- the inject function would need
to be overriden to tell TermWin what to do.
